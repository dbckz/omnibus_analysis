## OpenMined's Key Positions

### Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)
OpenMined advocates for EU-level regulatory recognition and standardisation of privacy-preserving computation protocols (federated learning, secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, decentralised data networks) as the solution to enable data collaboration without data transfer.
> "Privacy-preserving computation protocols resolve this tension not by weakening either objective, but by changing the fundamental paradigm: instead of moving data to computation, computation moves to the data."

### GDPR and data protection safeguards
OpenMined argues current GDPR frameworks create regulatory paralysis by assuming bilateral data transfers between two parties, when modern data is inherently multi-party. They advocate maintaining strong privacy protections but enabling them through technical measures rather than administrative processes.
> "The regulations assume data moves between two clearly defined parties, but modern data is multi-party from the start. Whether it's a family's smart thermostat or a network of hospitals collaborating on research, value now comes from interconnection, not transfer."

### Regulatory fragmentation and legal certainty
OpenMined strongly advocates for harmonised EU-level guidance rather than 27 different Member State interpretations. They argue regulatory uncertainty is the primary barrier to PET adoption, causing organisations to default to less privacy-protective traditional methods simply because their legal status is clearer.
> "Only EU-level legislative updates or regulatory guidance can provide the harmonised legal certainty necessary for these technologies to fulfil their potential. Without this clarity from Brussels, Europe risks worsening the damaging perception that it regulates against innovation rather than enabling it."

### SME and mid-cap accessibility
OpenMined argues current bilateral data-sharing frameworks create power asymmetries favouring large enterprises who can afford extensive legal teams and months-long bilateral negotiations, while SMEs are excluded from the data economy.
> "The framework thus creates a data economy accessible only to those who can afford both compliance infrastructure and extensive bilateral dealmaking."

### Technical standards as administrative simplification
OpenMined proposes replacing lengthy legal negotiations and contractual security requirements with mathematical privacy guarantees (differential privacy) and cryptographic proofs that can technically demonstrate compliance.
> "When using differential privacy with formally proven privacy bounds, organisations can mathematically demonstrate privacy protection levels, potentially replacing lengthy negotiations about privacy safeguards with standardised technical parameters."

### Data Act and Model Contractual Terms
OpenMined recommends integrating privacy-preserving computation protocols into the Data Act's model contractual terms and establishing a dedicated working group of legal, technical, and regulatory experts to address integration challenges.
> "The Digital Omnibus should acknowledge that potentially transformational privacy-preserving approaches are hindered by a notable lack of legal clarity. While the model contractual terms under development for the Data Act represent one opportunity to address this gap, a more comprehensive approach is needed."

### Common European Data Spaces
OpenMined argues privacy-preserving computation protocols could support the development of Common European Data Spaces while ensuring EU rules on personal data, consumer protection, and competition law are respected.
> "Such protocols could support the development of Common European Data Spaces while ensuring that EU rules and values with regard to personal data, consumer protection, and competition law are respected."

While both share a general concern for GDPR harmonisation, Protector PriVit does not address privacy-enhancing technologies, technical solutions, or the multi-party data collaboration challenges that are central to OpenMined's positions.

**Disagrees with OpenMined on:**
- Protector PriVit focuses on simplifying data subject rights exceptions, while OpenMined focuses on enabling multi-party data collaboration through technical solutions
- Protector PriVit's proposed simplification is purely legal/procedural, whereas OpenMined advocates for technical measures (PETs) as the path forward
- Protector PriVit does not engage with the technical innovation agenda that is core to OpenMined's position

The Anonymous response focuses entirely on geospatial data standardization (INSPIRE vs NKOD formats) and security concerns around spatial data, with no engagement with OpenMined's core positions on privacy-enhancing technologies, GDPR reform, or data collaboration frameworks. While both share a general concern for administrative simplification, the response's emphasis on restricting data openness for security reasons runs somewhat counter to OpenMined's goal of enabling more data sharing through technical safeguards.

**Disagrees with OpenMined on:**
- Response advocates for restricting data openness (geospatial data) for security reasons, while OpenMined advocates for enabling data sharing through PETs
- Response does not engage with privacy-enhancing technologies as a solution to data protection concerns
- Response focuses on national security restrictions rather than enabling cross-border data collaboration

Vlastimil Zíma's response focuses narrowly on cookie consent mechanisms and browser-based privacy controls (Do-Not-Track, Global Privacy Control), which represents a fundamentally different approach to privacy than OpenMined's focus on privacy-enhancing computation technologies. While both share a general concern for user privacy and data protection, Zíma's technical solutions operate at the consent/tracking layer rather than OpenMined's data collaboration and computation layer. There is no direct opposition, but virtually no substantive overlap in proposed solutions.

**Disagrees with OpenMined on:**
- Zíma focuses on consent/tracking layer while OpenMined focuses on data computation/collaboration layer
- Zíma does not address multi-party data sharing challenges central to OpenMined's position
- No engagement with privacy-preserving computation technologies that are OpenMined's core advocacy area

This response focuses on administrative simplification through peer-learning and best practice sharing between Member States, rather than addressing privacy-enhancing technologies or data protection frameworks. While it shares OpenMined's concern about regulatory burdens and fragmentation, it proposes a completely different solution (knowledge sharing and process replication) rather than technical standards and PETs.

**Disagrees with OpenMined on:**
- OpenMined advocates for technical standards (PETs) while this response advocates for peer-learning and process replication
- OpenMined focuses on data protection and privacy-preserving computation; this response focuses on administrative efficiency and e-government

UNIFE's response focuses narrowly on regulatory simplification for the rail industry, with no engagement on privacy-enhancing technologies, GDPR frameworks, or data collaboration methods that are central to OpenMined's positions. While both organizations support regulatory simplification, UNIFE's concerns are sector-specific (cybersecurity compliance for industrial goods) rather than about enabling privacy-preserving data sharing.

**Disagrees with OpenMined on:**
- UNIFE focuses on sector-specific compliance burdens for industrial goods while OpenMined focuses on enabling privacy-preserving data collaboration
- UNIFE's simplification agenda is about reducing requirements on manufacturers while OpenMined's is about enabling new forms of compliant data sharing
- No engagement from UNIFE on the technical solutions (PETs) that OpenMined advocates as the path to simplification

Movement for an Open Web advocates for weakening consent requirements and enabling broader tracking for advertising purposes, which fundamentally conflicts with OpenMined's position of maintaining strong privacy protections through technical measures. While both seek regulatory simplification, their approaches are diametrically opposed: OpenMined wants to enable data collaboration while preserving privacy through PETs, whereas Movement for an Open Web wants to reduce privacy requirements to facilitate advertising tracking.

**Disagrees with OpenMined on:**
- OpenMined advocates for strong privacy protections enabled through technical measures; Movement for an Open Web advocates for reduced consent requirements for tracking
- OpenMined sees privacy-preserving computation as the solution; Movement for an Open Web sees consent exemptions for advertising as the solution
- OpenMined focuses on enabling privacy-preserving data collaboration; Movement for an Open Web focuses on enabling tracking without consent barriers

This response takes a fundamentally different view from OpenMined on GDPR. While OpenMined wants to maintain strong privacy protections through technical means (PETs), this respondent views GDPR's broad privacy definitions as excessive overhead that harms startups. The respondent focuses on reducing privacy restrictions for analytics/tracking, whereas OpenMined focuses on enabling data collaboration while preserving privacy.

**Disagrees with OpenMined on:**
- OpenMined wants to maintain strong privacy protections through technical means; this respondent wants to narrow the definition of PII to exclude tracking identifiers
- OpenMined sees data collaboration as the goal; this respondent prioritizes user tracking and analytics capabilities
- OpenMined views PETs as the solution to enable privacy-preserving data use; this respondent implies the solution is reducing privacy requirements rather than technical privacy preservation

This response fundamentally opposes OpenMined's core premise. While OpenMined advocates for harmonised EU-level regulation and technical standards to enable privacy-preserving data collaboration, Eric argues against all EU regulation, viewing it as bureaucratic burden that hampers European competitiveness. The response rejects the need for any new regulatory frameworks, which directly contradicts OpenMined's call for regulatory recognition of PETs.

**Disagrees with OpenMined on:**
- Fundamental opposition to EU regulatory frameworks versus OpenMined's call for EU-level regulatory recognition of PETs
- Views regulation as competitive burden versus OpenMined's view that harmonised regulation enables innovation
- Believes existing international standards are sufficient versus OpenMined's advocacy for new EU-specific PET standards
