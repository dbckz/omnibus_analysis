### Ada Lovelace Institute (GBR, ACADEMIC_RESEARCH_INSTITTUTION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33089199_en)

**Position**: They argue that simplification should not come at the expense of fundamental rights and that industry must prove compliance costs before any protections are reduced.

> "the proposed simplification agenda should not come at the expense of people, society or fundamental rights"

> "It is imperative that the simplification process is an evidence-based one"


### Orla Harris (LUX, EU_CITIZEN)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33089182_en)

**Position**: The respondent opposes simplification of cookie rules, arguing that reducing tracking regulations would harm consumers' digital rights while only benefiting businesses.

> "Reducing rules on cookies and other tracking technologies makes the market fairer for only one side, of which the consumers are not a part of."

> "We already know what the effect that data misuse can have on our society; from election manipulation and rigging to an overconsumption of goods, consumers and users can be manipulated through the use of data."


### Anonymous (FRA, EU_CITIZEN)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33089165_en)

**Position**: The respondents advocate for stronger privacy protections through greater transparency, standardized consent interfaces, and addressing regulatory gaps that currently allow tracking and data combination practices that undermine user privacy.

> "We propose mandating a clear description of personal data usage before any data processing occurs, even in the context of providing the service"

> "novel methods of tracking like server-side tagging which transfers a website's tracking logic to the server side obscure the detection of data being collected and transmitted"


### European network of equality bodies (Equinet) (BEL, OTHER)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33089161_en)

**Position**: Equinet strongly opposes amendments that could weaken fundamental rights protections in the AI Act, advocating for regulatory clarity through guidance rather than legislative changes.

> "regulatory clarity must be achieved through guidance and information support, not through amendments that risk weakening fundamental rights protections before key EU AI Act provisions have entered into force"

> "the Act holds the potential to be a landmark achievement in balancing innovation with fundamental rights protection, with equality holding a prominent place in its fundamental rights protection framework"


### noyb (AUT, NGO)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33089113_en)

**Position**: noyb strongly advocates against rushed simplification that could reduce privacy protections, emphasizing that changes must benefit society and fundamental rights, not just business interests.

> "The Commissions simplification agenda should not lead to rushed proposals without proper consultation, evaluation and impact assessments"

> "Simplification must not be designed as a one-way street for business but should be pursued to benefit society as a whole and promote fundamental rights"


### INRIA and Utrecht University (NLD, ACADEMIC_RESEARCH_INSTITTUTION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33089063_en)

**Position**: Strongly advocates for maintaining current privacy protections under the ePrivacy Directive while reducing cookie fatigue through browser-based consent management rather than weakening consent requirements.

> "We particularly welcome the effort of improving and clarifying the application of the law to be achieved without weakening the level of privacy and personal data protection that the current legal framework offers to Internet users."

> "48% out of 3 947 participants in the EU said that are not ready to share their data. Similarly, 46% of participants of the same study have preferred not to be tracked when they were exposed to a clear choice between tracking and continuing using the website without being tracked"


### Access Now Europe (IRL, NGO)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088968_en)

**Position**: Access Now strongly opposes the Digital Omnibus package, viewing it as deregulation that will weaken fundamental rights protections in the EU, particularly regarding ePrivacy, GDPR, and the AI Act.

> "Access Now is first and foremost concerned that the Digital Package on Simplification will in effect amount to a programme of deregulation with serious negative consequences for fundamental rights protections in the European Union"

> "it is difficult to see how such negative impacts can be avoided if the proposed modifications are made to the laws in question, in particular the ePrivacy Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA)"


### Anonymous (LTU, EU_CITIZEN)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088944_en)

**Position**: The respondent urges the EU Commission to maintain citizens' privacy rights and personal data protections, opposing any simplification that would remove individual choice regarding cookies.

> "I simply want to ask EU commission to not abandon citizen's right to privacy and their own data"

> "any theoretical simplification should not take away personal choice on what choice to make concerning cookies"


### AI Accountability Lab (AIAL), Trinity College Dublin (IRL, ACADEMIC_RESEARCH_INSTITTUTION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088915_en)

**Position**: AIAL strongly opposes reducing regulatory safeguards, arguing that removing 'red tape' without assessing impacts to fundamental rights poses severe risks to citizens.

> "this lapse in typical rule making procedure is a severe risk to citizens"

> "the Commission's recent measures to increase the adoption of AI also risks creating new forms of surveillance, control, and violations at scale"


### European Network Against Racism (ENAR) (BEL, NGO)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088847_en)

**Position**: ENAR opposes weakening the AI Act and other digital regulations, viewing the Omnibus package as a concerning move that prioritizes business interests over protective safeguards.

> "ENAR regrets that even before the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is fully implemented, the Commission is thinking of making adjustments to this crucial piece of legislation"

> "It is even more concerning the fact that the goal of this action is to benefit businesses by reducing their burden to comply with the act"


### STM (NLD, BUSINESS_ASSOCIATION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088823_en)

**Position**: STM strongly supports maintaining existing safeguards and protections, arguing that simplification should make compliance easier without weakening rules or undermining enforcement.

> "simplification and streamlining cannot come at the expense of the safeguards, predictability and trust that underpin a responsible, safe and competitive digital ecosystem in Europe"

> "Simplification must therefore mean making compliance easier, not weakening rules or undermining enforcement"


### BEUC - The European Consumer Organisation (BEL, CONSUMER_ORGANISATION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088820_en)

**Position**: BEUC strongly opposes any simplification that could weaken consumer privacy protections, insisting that consent remains the fundamental requirement for data processing and device tracking.

> "BEUC welcomes the objective of simplification but stresses that this must not lead to deregulation"

> "Article 5(3) is clear: service providers are required to obtain consent to store or to access information on a users device"


### CERMI (ESP, NGO)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088784_en)

**Position**: CERMI strongly opposes any simplification that would reduce rights or protections, emphasizing that digital regulation must maintain enhanced safeguards for vulnerable groups like persons with disabilities.

> "CERMI welcomes the digital simplification promoted by the Commission, but reminds that it must not entail a reduction of rights or a lack of protection for social groups requiring enhanced safeguards, such as persons with disabilities"

> "This process must be approached from the human rights perspective mandated by the CRPD. Anything else would result in the creation of new digital barriers and the consolidation of exclusion"


### European Digital Rights (EDRi) (BEL, NGO)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088725_en)

**Position**: EDRi strongly opposes the simplification agenda, viewing it as deregulation that will undermine digital rights protections and erode legal certainty provided by the EU's digital acquis.

> "the Commissions simplification agenda is, as feared, a political push for deregulation"

> "It would also signal that the EU is letting itself be driven by corporate interests"


### Agilitation (FRA, COMPANY)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088147_en)

**Position**: They strongly support maintaining GDPR's core principles of informed, meaningful, contextual and granular user consent while opposing centralization of consent management in browser gatekeepers.

> "consent fatigue does not stem from the use of cookies or other technical tools. The focus should be on improving transparency, usability and proportionality — not on singling out specific technologies or business models"

> "Centralising consent management within proprietary browser mechanisms would risk undermining the specificity of consent, which must be contextual and granular, as required by the GDPR"


### European Savings and Retail Banking Group (BEL, BUSINESS_ASSOCIATION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088604_en)

**Position**: They advocate for narrowing data sharing scope, excluding gatekeepers, requiring EU establishment for third-country providers, and protecting sensitive financial data held by European institutions.

> "Narrow down the scope of FiDA, both as to the type of customers (only retail natural persons), and data categories (choose a very limited number of data categories based on evidenced needs of the market)"

> "development of schemes is driven by genuine market demand, while also rolled-out with a gradual approach and realistic timelines, especially given the lack of evidence supporting widespread interest in financial data sharing"


### Centre for Democracy and Technology Europe (BEL, NGO)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088551_en)

**Position**: They firmly oppose any simplification efforts that would weaken fundamental rights protections under the AI Act, emphasizing that simplification must not lead to deregulation.

> "we firmly oppose any form of simplification that would put the hard-won fundamental rights protections and obligations under the law into jeopardy"

> "Experiences with the first omnibus proposal on sustainability have shown how easily proposed amendments presented as simplification can touch upon the core substance of a law and seriously affect the fundamental rights protections anchored therein"


### European Trade Union Committee for Education (ETUCE) (BEL, TRADE_UNION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088527_en)

**Position**: ETUCE strongly supports maintaining existing EU digital regulatory safeguards, viewing them as essential protections for children, teachers, and education systems.

> "Europes digital regulatory framework is the most advanced in the world and is essential for upholding European democratic values"

> "In the education sector, these regulations are not just technical instruments, they are the backbone of protections for children, teachers, and the quality of our education systems"


### Bocconi University (ITA, ACADEMIC_RESEARCH_INSTITTUTION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088522_en)

**Position**: They argue that simplification should not weaken fundamental rights protections, and that data protection (Article 16 TFEU) must serve as an autonomous or co-equal legal foundation alongside market integration objectives.

> "simplification should not be understood as deregulation but as constitutional consolidation: reducing duplication and administrative costs without weakening the guarantees that protect fundamental rights and the rule of law"

> "Article 114 TFEU is appropriate for market-integration objectives, but where the measure affects the protection of personal data or privacy, Article 16 TFEU must operate as an autonomous or co-equal foundation"


### Homo Digitalis  (GRC, NGO)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088501_en)

**Position**: They oppose the Digital Omnibus proposal as a deregulatory initiative that risks dismantling fundamental digital rights protections under the guise of 'simplification'.

> "Η πρόταση της Ευρωπαϊκής Επιτροπής για το επικείμενο Ψηφιακό Γενικό Πρόγραμμα (Digital Omnibus) εντάσσεται σε ένα ευρύτερο πλέγμα απορρυθμιστικών πρωτοβουλιών, οι οποίες παρουσιάζονται υπό το πρόσχημα της «απλοποίησης»"

> "αυτή η προσέγγιση φαίνεται να επιχειρεί τη σταδιακή αποδόμηση θεμελιωδών προστασιών, παρουσιάζοντας τα δικαιώματα ως διοικητικά εμπόδια ή «γραφειοκρατία»"

> "Eliminate AI-related regulatory duplications, in particular in the context of regulatory competencies, incident notifications etc and accelerate guidance and standards and enforcement coordination"


### European Entrepreneurs CEA-PME (BEL, BUSINESS_ASSOCIATION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33089078_en)

**Position**: CEA-PME argues that GDPR is too vague and inconsistently applied, creating high compliance costs for SMEs, and calls for clearer, more practical privacy rules.

> "In Germany, sixteen regional data protection authorities have developed sixteen different interpretations, creating confusion, legal uncertainty and high compliance costs for SMEs"

> "The vague drafting of the GDPR has even enabled abusive legal actions against small firms"


### Confederation of Swedish Enterprise (SWE, NGO)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33089054_en)

**Position**: They advocate for simplifying GDPR and other digital regulations, reducing administrative documentation requirements, and clearing burdens that they argue do not increase consumer protection.

> "it would be rational to clear burdens of administrative requirements like documentation that do not increase the protection of consumers or society"

> "simplification of the complex rules like AI Act, GDPR, Data Act and CRA are needed to support compliance, legal certainty, innovation and competitiveness"


### WindEurope (BEL, NGO)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33089007_en)

**Position**: WindEurope argues that current consent and data protection requirements under the Data Act are disproportionately burdensome for critical infrastructure operators and should be simplified through standardised categories.

> "many customers do not respond to consent requests, making compliance with the Data Act impossible without breaching contractual duties"

> "Granular consent on a dataset-by-dataset and purpose-by-purpose basis is technically and economically unfeasible given the volume of industrial data"


### Relyens Mutual Insurance (FRA, COMPANY)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088953_en)

> "Il est important de reconnaître les spécificités du secteur santé, notamment la priorité à la sécurité des patients, même en situation de crise cyber"


### Schaeffler AG (DEU, COMPANY)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088950_en)

**Position**: Schaeffler advocates for data access rights to prevail over GDPR restrictions when data is anonymized or pseudonymized, viewing current privacy rules as obstacles to data sharing and innovation.

> "The GDPR precedence mentioned in the previous point becomes a systematic blocker for fleets and shared vehicles, where personal data is inevitably present."

> "Companies that have no interest in sharing data could bypass the requirements of the Data Act by simply mixing generated data with personal data that would fall under the GDPR."


### Lenovo (BEL, COMPANY)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088937_en)

**Position**: Lenovo advocates for reducing regulatory complexity and allowing companies to reuse existing compliance documentation across multiple regulations rather than creating new privacy safeguards.

> "Companies operating within the European Union face numerous challenges due to a highly complex and overlapping legislative landscape"

> "These requirements are closely tied to obligations under other regulations, such as the GDPR and NIS2 Directive, often resulting in duplicated efforts and administrative burdens"


### European Games Developer Federation (EGDF) (SWE, BUSINESS_ASSOCIATION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088932_en)

**Position**: EGDF advocates for significantly weakening GDPR protections by reducing documentation requirements, limiting breach notifications, lowering impact assessment thresholds, and adding conditions to complaint rights.

> "exempting uncomplicated and clearly defined data breaches from their notification obligation"

> "making the right to lodge a complaint conditional to prior notice with the data controller"


### Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA) (USA, BUSINESS_ASSOCIATION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088912_en)

**Position**: SIIA advocates for narrowing the scope of high-risk AI classifications in education, seeking to exclude AI-assisted learning tools from stringent regulatory requirements.

> "We are concerned that the classification of 'Education and vocational training' systems as high risk will make it difficult for the EdTech ecosystem in the EU to thrive and, as a result, to deliver tools and solutions that are designed to assist educators and students to succeed."

> "We request guidelines that clarify that paragraphs 3(b) and 3(c) in Annex III, which cover AI systems 'used to evaluate learning outcomes' and 'used for the purpose of assessing the appropriate level of education,' apply to 'AI-determined' outcomes, not to 'AI-assisted' outcomes when a human is involved in rendering a decision."


### Dutch Startup Association (NLD, BUSINESS_ASSOCIATION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088893_en)

**Position**: The DSA advocates for simplifying consent mechanisms and harmonizing compliance processes, prioritizing regulatory clarity for startups over strengthening privacy protections.

> "Startups currently face overlapping regulations from the DSA/DMA to the AI Act and Data Act which hinder growth and cross-border scaling"

> "Simplification, not deregulation: The EU should harmonize definitions, align compliance processes, and introduce a startup impact check"


### The European Crypto Initiative (EUCI) (BEL, NGO)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088863_en)

> "two horizontal clarifications will unlock the greatest simplification at the lowest cost"


### AI Swiftly Sweden AB (SWE, COMPANY)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088862_en)

**Position**: AI Swiftly supports simplifying cookie consent rules and streamlining the data acquis to reduce administrative burden, indicating a preference for less restrictive privacy requirements.

> "We see value in streamlining the data acquis and simplifying cookie consent rules"

> "We recommend that the Commission prioritise clarity and proportionality for SMEs and mid-caps, and avoid overlapping obligations across digital laws"


### Leading Baltic tech and other businesses and professional associations listed in the submission (LTU, COMPANY)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088842_en)

**Position**: They strongly support reducing GDPR and ePrivacy obligations, arguing current rules are overly formalistic and divert resources from genuine privacy protection toward compliance-first routines.

> "Even the Commission's own advisory reports have warned that the GDPR 'hampers innovation', imposes excessive burdens, and drives up costs in the European market."

> "non-essential, process-heavy obligations across EU legislation that add cost and complexity without materially improving outcomes for individuals are diverting resources from genuine privacy-first practices toward compliance-first routines."


### OpenAI (USA, COMPANY)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088837_en)

**Position**: OpenAI advocates for streamlining and simplifying privacy/data protection compliance requirements across EU digital laws, framing GDPR obligations as overlapping burdens that create inefficiencies and stifle innovation.

> "A European Parliament study found that the accumulation of recent regulations represents a cost of €28 billion for the first year of compliance for SMEs."

> "Companies—especially mid-caps, SMEs and startups—must comply with parallel, sometimes redundant reporting and audit requirements. This duplication creates inefficiencies, raises compliance costs, and ultimately stifles innovation."


### Centre for Information Policy Leadership (CIPL) (BEL, OTHER)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088830_en)

**Position**: CIPL advocates for simplifying GDPR compliance through targeted amendments, reducing consent burdens, and adopting risk-based rather than prescriptive approaches, while maintaining accountability frameworks.

> "The continued preference of consent, often required across multiple digital laws, has created an unsustainable model that puts an undue burden on the individual and ultimately weakens privacy protections."

> "This complexity increases compliance costs and diverts resources from innovation and meaningful data protection outcomes."


### Bolt (EST, COMPANY)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088824_en)

**Position**: Bolt advocates for aligning and simplifying privacy-related regulations like GDPR with other digital rules to reduce administrative burden, framing this as efficiency rather than deregulation.

> "Simplification would not mean deregulation. It means ensuring that strong European rules can be applied efficiently, consistently, and at scale."

> "The interaction of overlapping instruments pursuing similar objectives—safety, fairness, and transparency—but through different processes and reporting requirements can result is legal uncertainty, administrative duplication, and fragmented national implementation."


### Alliance Digitale (FRA, BUSINESS_ASSOCIATION)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088807_en)

**Position**: Alliance Digitale strongly advocates for reducing GDPR compliance burdens on businesses, particularly SMEs, and seeks to narrow the scope of data subject rights and consent requirements.

> "Alliance Digitale welcomes the European Commissions ambitious simplification agenda for the EU rulebook"

> "Exempt SMEs and startups with fewer than 50 employees, which do not aim to process sensitive data, from the obligation to maintain records of processing activities"

**Details**: They advocate for recognising 'functional anonymisation' where cryptographic safeguards make re-identification not reasonably likely, suggesting PETs should be used as a basis for lighter regulatory treatment.

> "recognising functional anonymisation where cryptographic safeguards make re-identification not reasonably likely"


### Skyscanner (GBR)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088763_en)

**Details**: Skyscanner mentions that the regulatory framework should incentivise the use of privacy-enhancing solutions, suggesting PETs could enable easier data collection where privacy impacts are low.

> "incentivises the use of privacy-enhancing solutions, and allows organisations to collect important information more easily where privacy impacts are low"


### European Tech Alliance (BEL)
[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088667_en)

**Details**: EUTA proposes that Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) should be explicitly recognized as a proportionate safeguard for reading and storing low-sensitivity data under the modernized ePrivacy framework. They emphasize PETs must be deployable at scale, accessible throughout the value chain, made available free of charge, and governed by EU-level standards to ensure interoperability and prevent market dominance by any single provider.

> "The 'modernization' of the rules on cookies expressed in the call for evidence should also explicitly recognise Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a proportionate safeguard for the reading and storing of data (low-sensitivity data). Embedding PETs in this way would ensure that data use remains privacy-preserving, interoperable, and consistent with EU standards, while avoiding undue reliance on any single provider."

[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088597_en)

**Details**: They argue that current outdated rules are actually stifling innovation in privacy-enhancing technologies, as companies focus on navigating consent requirements rather than investing in privacy-by-design solutions. They specifically mention data clean rooms and contextual targeting as examples of PETs that could offer both privacy and sustainable business models.

> "these outdated rules are stifling innovation in privacy-enhancing technologies, as companies focus on navigating complex consent requirements rather than investing in new privacy-by-design solutions such as secure data clean rooms or contextual targeting models that could offer both high privacy standards and sustainable business models"

**Details**: The respondents argue that the binary distinction between personal and non-personal data in GDPR Article 4.1 is outdated due to browser fingerprinting research. They identify a 'grey zone' of technical data (HTTP headers, JavaScript APIs, CPU/GPU benchmarks) that can identify individuals through their devices even though such data might be considered 'purely technical' and non-personal. This effectively critiques the assumption that technical/pseudonymous data cannot be used for identification.

> "We argue that this distinction is no longer up to date with the state-of-the-art of research in the domain of browser fingerprinting: a grey zone of data that can reveal personal information exists between the two extremes of personal and non personal data."

[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088950_en)

**Details**: Schaeffler argues that companies circumvent Data Act requirements by mixing generated data with personal data to invoke GDPR protections, and that lack of 'GDPR-proof pseudonymization pathways' creates barriers to vehicle data access. They want data access rights to prevail when personal data has been anonymized or pseudonymized.

> "To prevent circumvention, it is important to provide clarification in instances, where there is the question of whether the GDPR takes precedence over the Data Act. In this particular case, the right to access data should prevail, when personal data has been anonymized or pseudonymized."

[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088583_en)

**Details**: Orange argues that the Data Act's concept of 'user's non-personal data' is incoherent because if data can be indirectly linked to individuals through additional identifiers, it constitutes pseudonymized data under GDPR, making the distinction between personal and non-personal data misleading.

> "Conversely, if the data can be indirectly linked to individuals through additional identifiers, they constitute pseudonymized data and should be treated as personal data under the GDPR, rendering the term 'non-personal data' inaccurate."

**Details**: CLEPA argues that data holders may circumvent data-sharing obligations by categorising operational data as 'personal' and invoking GDPR, and recommends that data-sharing obligations should prevail where data has been effectively anonymised or pseudonymised. They also call for GDPR-compliant pseudonymisation procedures to prevent undue restrictions on data access.

> "Prevent circumvention by specifying that data-sharing obligations prevail where the personal data in question has been effectively anonymised or pseudonymised."

**Details**: VDA proposes 'GDPR-proof pseudonymization pathways' for vehicle data to address the problem that data access is currently refused solely because personal data is present, particularly affecting fleets and shared vehicles where personal data is co-mingled with telemetry.

> "Mandate a portable, machine-readable proof-of-consent/authorization standard for vehicle data/functions under the Data Act, with clear role allocation (holder/recipient/processor) and GDPR-proof pseudonymization pathways so that access cannot be refused solely because personal data is present."

[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33087752_en)

**Details**: ITI argues that pseudonymized data receives insufficient regulatory recognition compared to anonymized data, creating a disincentive for companies to use privacy-enhancing techniques. They advocate for treating pseudonymized data more flexibly, closer to the approach taken with anonymous data, and introducing a more realistic standard for likelihood of re-identification.

> "Pseudonymized data is a key example. While it significantly limits the ability to link data to individuals, it is afforded little regulatory recognition compared to anonymized data. As a result, the framework provides insufficient incentives for companies to use privacy-enhancing techniques, even where they meaningfully reduce risks to individuals."

[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33087277_en)

**Details**: Bitkom identifies a fundamental problem: pseudonymized data is still considered personal data under GDPR (Recital 26), which creates conflicts with the Data Act's data sharing requirements. They note the DORA Regulation creates technical conflict by permitting pseudonymized data storage in non-production environments while GDPR treats it as personal data. They call for clear, legally binding requirements for pseudonymization and anonymization.

> "However, it should be noted that the use of pseudonymous data does not exempt data from the obligations under the Data Act. Therefore, the proposal is: mixed datasets should not be treated as personal data if the personal data has been pseudonymized according to recognized standards and re-identification by unauthorized third parties can be effectively excluded."

[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33087066_en)

**Details**: Salesforce argues that the GDPR's high bar for true anonymization is virtually impossible to prove, especially given modern AI capabilities. They contend this causes data intended for AI analysis to be regulated as personal data even when minimal re-identification risk exists, unnecessarily triggering full compliance requirements for low-risk applications.

> "Because true anonymization is virtually impossible to prove, data intended for AI analysis is often regulated as personal data even if minimal risk exists. This risks unnecessarily triggering the full compliance regime (DPIAs, consent, rights of erasure) for low-risk applications."

**Position**: They argue legitimate interest is too narrowly interpreted by CJEU and regulators, and propose either replacing Article 6's enumerated legal bases with a general authorization when GDPR principles are met, or significantly broadening legitimate interest to cover AI development, big data, digital platforms, and data monetization.

> "the legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)) and contractual (Art. 6(1)(b)) bases are often applied too narrowly by the CJEU, European Data Protection Board, and national authorities, leading to an overly restrictive interpretation that discourages innovation and developments in AI, digital platforms, and data-driven sectors."

**Position**: Strongly supports expanding legitimate interest as a legal basis, arguing there should be no hierarchy between GDPR legal bases and that over-reliance on consent creates unsustainable burdens on individuals while weakening privacy protections. Points to UK DUAA as a model for pre-approved legitimate interest activities.

> "A future-adaptive regulatory framework should affirm that there is no hierarchy between the legal bases of the GDPR and empower the responsible use of data, supported by strong accountability measures and risk management that do not put the onus on the individual."

**Position**: Strongly supports allowing legitimate interest as a legal basis under ePrivacy, aligned with GDPR, to reduce consent fatigue and ensure consistency in EU law.

> "The ePrivacy framework should allow for alternative lawful bases for processing, such as legitimate interest and the performance of a contract, mirroring the GDPR. This approach reduces 'consent fatigue' among users and ensures consistency in EU law, especially where processing does not pose significant risks."

**Position**: Orange argues that Data Act Article 8(4) conflicts with GDPR legitimate interest provisions by preventing data holders from sharing data with third parties except at user request, which they claim creates 'locked datasets' and hinders lawful innovation including AI development.

> "Under the GDPR, data controllers may rely on lawful bases for processing personal data, such as the performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b)) or legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f)). However, Article 8(4) of the Data Act prevents data holders from making data available to third parties except at the explicit request of the user. This provision risks creating 'locked datasets,' limiting legitimate data uses otherwise permitted under the GDPR."

[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33088566_en)

**Position**: They strongly advocate for expanding legitimate interest to explicitly cover AI training, arguing that GDPR Recital 47's concept of legitimate interest should be 'clearly extended for the purposes of training AI systems as a recognised legitimate interest' with appropriate safeguards. They also express concern that the Data Act may undermine GDPR legitimate interest provisions.

> "Recital 47 of the GDPR underpins the concept of legitimate interest of data controllers to process certain data. This concept should be clearly extended for the purposes of training AI systems as a recognised legitimate interest."

**Position**: They note that the public sector cannot use the 'balancing of interests rule' under Article 6(1)(f), which they see as creating barriers to AI development and digital innovation. They suggest reviewing Article 6 for improvement while acknowledging the rationale for requiring clear legal basis for citizen data processing.

> "the public sector cannot use the 'balancing of interests rule' in letter f) as the fundamental and sensible point of view in GDPR is that information on citizens can only be processed when there is a clear legal basis for it... but at the same time it creates a scenario that slows down digital development"

**Position**: CoESS argues that the interpretation of 'legitimate' or 'substantial' public interest under Articles 6 and 9 varies too much by Member State and creates legal uncertainty for private security companies processing data for public security and crime prevention purposes. They want an EU-level evaluation of how these provisions are transposed.

> "The definition of necessary and proportionate restrictions of obligations resulting from GDPR to safeguard public security as per Art. 23.1.d, as well as the interpretation of data processing purposes, which are of 'legitimate' or 'substantial' public interest as per Articles 6 and 91, depend on the interpretation of Member State law and competent authorities."

[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33087295_en)

**Position**: They argue legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)) is applied too narrowly by CJEU, EDPB, and national authorities, and should be significantly broadened to clearly cover AI development, big data, digital platforms, and data monetization. They propose either making Article 5 principles a general authorization for processing (replacing Article 6 legal bases entirely) or substantially reinforcing legitimate interest as a key processing ground.

> "The legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)) and contractual (Art. 6(1)(b)) bases are often applied too narrowly by the CJEU, European Data Protection Board, and national authorities, leading to an overly restrictive interpretation that discourages innovation and developments in AI, digital platforms, and data-driven sectors."

[View submission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14855-Simplification-digital-package-and-omnibus/F33087277_en)

**Position**: Bitkom advocates for allowing legitimate interests as a legal basis for low-risk data processing activities currently requiring consent under ePrivacy, particularly for essential activities like analytics. They propose deleting Art. 5(3) from the ePrivacy Directive and introducing a modern, risk-based provision into GDPR that would allow essential, low-risk activities to proceed on legitimate interests basis subject to GDPR's balancing test.

> "Deleting Art. 5(3) from the ePrivacy Directive and introducing a modern, risk-based provision into the GDPR would be the most effective simplification. This would allow essential, low-risk activities to proceed on a more appropriate legal basis like legitimate interests, subject to the GDPR's robust balancing test and safeguards."

**Position**: Salesforce supports using legitimate interest as a legal basis for AI training, citing CNIL's June 2025 guidance as a model approach. They argue consent is impractical for AI model training and recommend the Commission promote the CNIL approach while also proposing amendments to GDPR Recital 32 to make consent more workable for AI development.

> "Consent is a challenging legal basis to use in practice when training AI models, leaving companies with fewer options and often forcing them to rely on legitimate interest (LI), which requires a Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA)."

**Position**: Argues that GPC signal should trigger Article 21 objection to processing by third-party data controllers under legitimate interest, while preserving the consumer-facing business's ability to conduct direct marketing. Notes that controller-to-controller data transfers under legitimate interest are already risky, and continuing over data subject objection is 'at best an adventurous position.'

> "Where the legal basis is legitimate interest, the data subject is objecting to processing by data controllers other than the consumer-facing business and to the transfer of data to other data controllers, as per Article 21(1-3, 5)."
